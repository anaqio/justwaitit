# ANAQIO Feature Roadmap & Implementation Plan

> **For Claude:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task.

**Goal:** Bridge the gap between the current landing page and a functional, interactive AI fashion studio, while tailoring the brand for the Moroccan market.

**Architecture:** A multi-phase rollout focusing on client-side interactivity (Interactive Preview), core AI features (Editor & Lookbook), and brand localization (Moroccan MAD/DH pricing and high-end Moroccan fashion aesthetic).

**Tech Stack:** Next.js (App Router), Supabase (Auth/DB), Remotion (Video Production), Framer Motion (UI Interactivity), Zod (Validation).

## Missing Features Definition

- **Feature A: AI Studio Workspace (The Editor)**
  - **Description:** A browser-based professional workspace where users can upload fashion assets, adjust lighting, swap backgrounds, and apply AI-driven "style transfer" to garments.
  - **Status:** In Development (Alpha scheduled for Q2 2026).

- **Feature B: AI Lookbook Generator**
  - **Description:** An automated tool that takes a collection of product shots and generates a cohesive, editorial-style lookbook with AI-generated models and Moroccan settings.
  - **Status:** Phase 3.

---

## Interactive Preview

- **Scope:** A "try-before-you-buy" component embedded in the landing page allowing users to toggle backgrounds and lighting styles on high-end garments.
- **User Flow:**
  1. **Select Environment:** User chooses between "Sahara Sunset", "Marrakech Riad", or "Atlas Morning".
  2. **AI Simulation:** Visual feedback shows "AI Relighting" process.
  3. **Result:** Background and garment lighting update to match the selected vibe.
- **Implementation:** Done via `components/sections/interactive-preview.tsx`.

## User Stories

- **US1:** As a Moroccan fashion brand owner, I want to see pricing in DH, so that I can immediately calculate ROI in local currency.
- **US2:** As a creative director, I want to see the introduction video, so that I can understand the brand's aesthetic quality instantly.

## Acceptance Criteria

- **AC1:** Pricing sections must display "DH" or "MAD" exclusively.
- **AC2:** The introduction video must be 9:16 format and reflect high-end luxury fashion.
- **AC3:** Interactive Preview must complete "transformation" in under 2 seconds.
